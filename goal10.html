    <h1>Why Should you care about Goal 10?</h1>
    <p> Goal 10 of the UNSDG and is one that can be applied easily into our lives, especially during the 21st century. Inequalities as a whole has become a major topic currently as the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us how often the most vulnerable are often targeted and treated unfairly. As socieity as a whole moves forward, it is esstenital that we acknowledge the systemic inequalities that the world is built on and create plans in order to make real change.</p>
    <p>An example of inequalities in the 21st century is how the COVID-19 pandmeic has effected different groups of individuals. In Canada, while the pandemic has caused much many households to be just hunderdeds of dollars from bankruptcy, the wealthy continue to become richer  as the stock market soars to all time highs even while the economy collapsed. Forbes Magazine estimates that the 2,200 plus billionaires in the world have collectively gotten 1.9 trillion richer in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.
    <p>Economic inequality is just one of the many inequalities that is plaguing soceity. It is crucial that we understand and work with Goal 10 of the UNSDG's as if we don't take actions, the results could be catastrophic causing society to lose the progress it has made in recent years</p>
